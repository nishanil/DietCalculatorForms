DietCalculatorForms
===================

DietCalculator built for 4 mobile platforms(iOS, Android, & Universal Windows) using shareable codebase in Portable Class Libraries. Xamarin.Forms is used to build the UI.


## About Diet Calculator


DietCalculator is a Silverlight MVC application written few years ago that calcuates daily diet requirements based on few inputs from the user. [Check this blog](http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Exploring-the-Model-View-Controller-MVC-pattern.aspx )

Many .NET developers working on the Windows platform donâ€™t realize that lots of existing .NET code can easily be ported to all the popular mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Almost any .NET codebase, including Windows Forms, WPF, ASP.NET, and Silverlight, has sharable code that can be ported to Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, and Universal Windows platforms. 

This project demonstrates the re-use of platform agnostic C# code on all the major platforms using Xamarin.Forms.

If you're looking for step by step instructions, refer these blogs:

- [Porting existing .NET apps to iOS](http://blog.xamarin.com/porting-existing-.net-apps-to-ios/)
- [Porting existing .NET apps to Android](http://blog.xamarin.com/porting-existing-.net-apps-to-android/)
- [Porting existing .NET apps to four mobile platforms](http://blog.xamarin.com/porting-existing-.net-apps-to-four-mobile-platforms-with-pcl/)

>Please note: All of the above links guide you to port using Native UIs which was created much before Xamarin.Forms existed. The concepts for porting any .NET apps to Mobile remain the same regardless of the UI technology used. In this case, Xamarin.Forms helped me build UI rapidly without investing much time building platform specific code.
